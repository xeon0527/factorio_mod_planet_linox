Planet Linox - Probably the smallest planet in Factorio.
==================================================
For some reason, this planet orbits extremely close to its sun. Its orbit is astronomically impossible, so something must have happened to this planet.

Because it’s so close to the sun, the surface has completely melted into a lava sea. Even if you explore it, it seems like a completely useless planet… Wait, isn’t there something over there?

Surviving in a confined space
==================================================
The surface of this planet is entirely covered by a sea of lava, so nothing can be done above ground. However, someone built a facility here that allows access to the deep underground. We must explore the planet’s secrets from this facility and escape again.

Recursive Blueprint System
==================================================
This facility was not built for factory construction. Because of that, the space is so limited that building a proper factory let alone a large-scale one is nearly impossible. However, even in a place like this, there is a way to build a meaningful factory. That solution is the recursive blueprint system.

![welcome_on_linox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeon0527/factorio_mod_planet_linox/main/.web/tips.mp4)

Through this system, you must forget the factories you knew before and rethink a completely new factory structure suited for this place.

Rewards
==================================================
 * Advanced rocket silo
>A high‑performance rocket silo capable of operating under extremely harsh conditions. It functions four times faster than a standard rocket silo and can be loaded onto space platform.  
  
 * Mantle extractor
>Drills through planetary crusts with a colossal drill, reaching the mantle to extract lava. Lava becomes accessible anywhere, but the process consumes massive amounts of energy and generates significant pollution.  
  
 * Core roboport
>A compact roboport with a very limited operational range but an exceptionally fast charging speed.  
  
 * Turbo pump
>A high-performance pump that consumes a large amount of energy in exchange for superior output.  
  
 * Sintering machine
>A machine that heats powder materials and compresses them under high pressure to form solid blocks. 
  
 * Outlet
>The outlet allows you to dump wastewater into the ocean. The fish will eat or drink it somehow and probably clean it up... right?  
  
 * Neodymium permanent magnet generator
>A generator that uses neodymium permanent magnets. Thanks to the powerful magnetic force of neodymium, a high-efficiency, high-capacity generator could be compressed down to this size.
  
 * Erbium beacon
>Using Erbium to improve the signal tower efficiency reportedly allows you to equip twice as many modules. Can you feel the immense power of the rare earth elements?  
  
 * Rare earth Productivity Technology
>It improves rare earth production. and as a small bonus, it also reduces pollution.  
  
 * Sintering machine Productivity
>Improves the productivity of the sintering machine. It seems like more comes out than the materials you put in… could this be called "creation"?  
  
 * Samarium Robotics
>By harnessing Samarium’s high-temperature properties, flying robots can gain enhanced durability and fire immunity, and temporarily operate at 300% overload. It’s like “eat fast, poop fast.”  
  
 * Neodymium permanent magnet inserter
>By harnessing the immense torque of neodymium permanent-magnet motors, inserter performance can be boosted to revolutionary levels. Their arms move so fast that it’s nearly impossible to track them with the naked eye. You might even get dizzy—so please, kids, don’t try this at home.

Recommended companion mods
==================================================
 * [Blueprint Sandboxes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/blueprint-sandboxes) - It makes editing blueprints significantly easier.
 * [Squeak Through 2](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/squeak-through-2) - Since space is extremely limited, being able to walk between buildings makes gameplay much more comfortable.
 * [Compact circuits](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/compaktcircuit) - On Linox, circuit builds can feel overwhelmingly bulky. This mod solves that problem entirely.
