This mod is in beta. It has reached a relatively stable stage as maintenance continues, but the addition of new systems or entities may still cause changes to gameplay.



Planet Linox - Probably the smallest planet in Factorio.
==================================================
For some reason, this planet orbits extremely close to its sun. Its orbit is astronomically impossible, so something must have happened to this planet.

Because it’s so close to the sun, the surface has completely melted into a lava sea. Even if you explore it, it seems like a completely useless planet… Wait, isn’t there something over there?

Surviving in a confined space
==================================================
The surface of this planet is entirely covered by a sea of lava, so nothing can be done above ground. However, someone built a facility here that allows access to the deep underground. We must explore the planet’s secrets from this facility and escape again.

<br/>
Recursive Blueprint System
==================================================
This facility was not built for factory construction. Because of that, the space is so limited that building a proper factory let alone a large-scale one is nearly impossible. However, even in a place like this, there is a way to build a meaningful factory. That solution is the recursive blueprint system.

![welcome_on_pelagos](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xeon0527/factorio_mod_planet_linox/main/.web/tips.mp4)

Through this system, you must forget the factories you knew before and rethink a completely new factory structure suited for this place.

Rewards
==================================================
 * Advanced rocket silo


I plan to focus on developing this mod for the time being, and I will do my best to address any feedback regarding game balance or bugs as quickly as possible.

Thank you for playing.
