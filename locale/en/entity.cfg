[entity-description]
linox-npc_lorax=A colossal artificial intelligence that governs the entire planet of Linox.
linox-npc_network-terminal=A terminal that provides access to the Linox planetary network.
linox-npc_power-converter=A massive power control unit that manages the electrical network of Linox facilities.

linox-building_advanced-rocket-silo=A high‑performance rocket silo capable of operating under extremely harsh conditions. It functions four times faster than a standard rocket silo and can be loaded onto space platform.
linox-building_cargo-elevator=A conveyor belt designed to transfer items through Linox facility terminals.
linox-building_cargo-landing-pad=A cargo landing pad designed for research purposes, not suitable for large-scale logistics operations.
linox-building_planetary-power-network=The power grid connecting the entire planet of Linox.
linox-building_core-roboport=A compact roboport with a very limited operational range but an exceptionally fast charging speed.
linox-building_deep-oil-pumpjack=Extracts crude oil still preserved deep underground.
linox-building_fluid-elevator=A pipe used to transport liquids through the terminals of Linox facility.
linox-building_fluid-elevator-input=A pump used to transport liquids through the terminals of Linox facility.
linox-building_fluid-elevator-output=A pump used to transport liquids through the terminals of Linox facility.
linox-building_mantle-extractor=Drills through planetary crusts with a colossal drill, reaching the mantle to extract lava. Lava becomes accessible anywhere, but the process consumes massive amounts of energy and generates significant pollution.
linox-building_sulfuric-acid-pumpjack=Extracts sulfuric acid still preserved deep underground.
linox-building_turbo-pump=A high-performance pump that consumes a large amount of energy in exchange for superior output.

linox-building_linox-supercomputer=A special supercomputer capable of withstanding the harsh environment of Linox. It seems L.O.R.A.X is secretly interested in it.
linox-building_sintering-machine=A machine that heats powder materials and compresses them under high pressure to form solid blocks.
linox-npc_power-converter-circuit-input=Input circuit signals here to control the power converter.
linox-npc_power-converter-circuit-output=Read the circuit output here and use it for control logic.
linox-hidden_reactive-power=Reactive power occurs when the power converter cannot efficiently manage electricity.

linox-building_chemical-tank=The chemical vat can perform complex chemical processes using large amounts of fluid.
linox-building_outlet=The outlet allows you to dump wastewater into the ocean. The fish will eat or drink it somehow and probably clean it up... right?
linox-building_chemical-filter=The chemical filter selectively extracts desired substances from a solution through physical and chemical processes. Like someone annoyingly picky who only picks out the tasty parts.
linox-building_huge-heat-exchanger=An intimidatingly massive heat exchanger. It can handle up to 250 MW of thermal energy.
linox-building_neodymium-permanent-magnet-generator=A generator that uses neodymium permanent magnets. Thanks to the powerful magnetic force of neodymium, a high-efficiency, high-capacity generator could be compressed down to this size.

linox-building_erbium-beacon=Using Erbium to improve the signal tower efficiency reportedly allows you to equip twice as many modules. Can you feel the immense power of the rare earth elements?
