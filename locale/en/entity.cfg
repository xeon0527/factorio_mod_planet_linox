[entity-description]
linox-entity_npc-lorax=A colossal artificial intelligence that governs the entire planet of Linox.
linox-entity_npc-network-terminal=A terminal that provides access to the Linox planetary network.
linox-entity_npc-power-converter=A massive power control unit that manages the electrical network of Linox facilities.
linox-entity_advanced-rocket-silo=A high‑performance rocket silo capable of operating under extremely harsh conditions. It functions four times faster than a standard rocket silo and can be loaded onto spacecraft.
linox-entity_cargo-elevator=A conveyor belt designed to transfer items through Linox installation terminals.
linox-entity_cargo-landing-pad=A cargo landing pad designed for research purposes, not suitable for large-scale logistics operations.
linox-entity_planetary-power-network=The power grid connecting the entire planet of Linox.
linox-entity_reactive-power=Reactive power occurs when the power converter cannot efficiently manage electricity.
linox-entity_core-roboport=A compact roboport with a very limited operational range but an exceptionally fast charging speed.
linox-entity_deep-oil-pumpjack=Extracts crude oil still preserved deep underground.
linox-entity_fluid-elevator=A pump used to transport liquids through the terminals of Linox installation.
linox-entity_fluid-elevator-input=A pump used to transport liquids through the terminals of Linox installation.
linox-entity_fluid-elevator-output=A pump used to transport liquids through the terminals of Linox installation.
linox-entity_mantle-extractor=Drills through planetary crusts with a colossal drill, reaching the mantle to extract lava. Lava becomes accessible anywhere, but the process consumes massive amounts of energy and generates significant pollution.
linox-entity_sulfuric-acid-pumpjack=Extracts sulfuric acid still preserved deep underground.
linox-entity_turbo-pump=A high-performance pump that consumes a large amount of energy in exchange for superior output.
