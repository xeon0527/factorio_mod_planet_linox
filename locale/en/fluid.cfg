[fluid-description]
low-concentration-neodymium-solution=A solution containing neodymium, though still faint and barely noticeable.
high-concentration-neodymium-solution=A solution containing neodymium, now noticeably more saturated.
neodymium-solution=A fully concentrated neodymium solution — full of potential, like a child with limitless possibilities.
waste-water=Useless wastewater discharged from the factory. It smells awful.
low-concentration-erbium-solution=A solution with a low concentration of erbium. You can barely tell the erbium is there.
high-concentration-erbium-solution=A solution with a high concentration of erbium. Now the erbium is noticeably present.
erbium-solution=A solution ready for erbium extraction. Exciting times ahead.
