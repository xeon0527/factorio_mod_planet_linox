rare-earth-powder=Rare earth powder mixed with various minerals and stones.
samarium-powder=Clean samarium powder separated from rare earth powder. This powder can be sintered to obtain samarium.
samarium=Samarium serves as a material for permanent magnets capable of operating at extremely high temperatures.
tungsten-gear-wheel=Materials made from tungsten exhibit very high operating temperatures and excellent durability.
tungsten-stick=Materials made from tungsten exhibit very high operating temperatures and excellent durability.
dysprosium-powder=Dysprosium is known to enhance the performance of permanent magnets and exhibits magnetostrictive behavior, meaning its length changes depending on the magnetic field. It is said to be extremely difficult to extract.
dysprosium-exoskeleton-equipment=Reinforced with tungsten steel and powered by synthetic dysprosium muscle fibers, reducing power consumption while improving performance.

linox-item_lava-data-card=They say the lava on Linox contains almost every substance imaginable dissolved in it. Even lava has something to teach us.
linox-item_rare-earth-data-card=Rare earth elements are used as chemical catalysts or to greatly enhance the properties of materials. Why are there so many things in this world to learn?
linox-item_samarium-data-card=They say that by understanding samarium, we can gain a deeper understanding of electromagnetic fields under high-temperature conditions. Just how much more do we need to learn?
linox-item_dysprosium-data-card=Dysprosium is commonly used as an additive in neodymium permanent magnets, and is also utilized in semiconductor manufacturing and special alloys such as Terfenol. Rumor has it that wizards love using it as a potion ingredient.

linox-tool_badchest-area-viewer=Displays the operating range of the BAD chest.
