[item-description]
linox-item_advanced-rocket-silo=A high‑performance rocket silo capable of operating under extremely harsh conditions. It functions four times faster than a standard rocket silo and can be loaded onto space platform.
linox-item_cargo-elevator=A conveyor belt designed to transfer items through Linox facility terminals.
linox-item_core-roboport=A compact roboport with a very limited operational range but an exceptionally fast charging speed.
linox-item_fluid-elevator=A pump used to transport liquids through the terminals of Linox facility.
linox-item_mantle-extractor=Drills through planetary crusts with a colossal drill, reaching the mantle to extract lava. Lava becomes accessible anywhere, but the process consumes massive amounts of energy and generates significant pollution.
linox-item_rare-earth-ore=A rare earth ore containing a mix of various minerals and stones.
linox-item_samarium=Samarium serves as a material for permanent magnets capable of operating at extremely high temperatures.
linox-item_tungsten-gear-wheel=Materials made from tungsten exhibit very high operating temperatures and excellent durability.
linox-item_turbo-pump=A high-performance pump that consumes a large amount of energy in exchange for superior output.

linox-item_tungsten-stick=Materials made from tungsten exhibit very high operating temperatures and excellent durability.
linox-item_linox-supercomputer=A special supercomputer capable of withstanding the harsh environment of Linox. It seems L.O.R.A.X is secretly interested in it.
linox-item_lava-data-card=They say the lava on Linox contains almost every substance imaginable dissolved in it. Even lava has something to teach us.
linox-item_rare-earth-data-card=Rare earth elements are used as chemical catalysts or to greatly enhance the properties of materials. Why are there so many things in this world to learn?
linox-item_samarium-data-card=They say that by understanding samarium, we can gain a deeper understanding of electromagnetic fields under high-temperature conditions. Just how much more do we need to learn?
