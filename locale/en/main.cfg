linox=Planet Linox

[mod-description]
linox=Linox is an extraordinarily destructive world, even closer to the sun than Vulcanus. Solar coronal ejections and flares reach all the way down to the surface, obliterating everything in their path, while the sun’s immense gravitational forces relentlessly twist and deform the entire planet, creating an extreme and hostile environment. Is there really anything left on such a world that could still be worth extracting?

[recipe-description]
linox-recipe_advanced-acid-neutralisation=Converts sulfuric acid into high-temperature steam. On Linox, this process can be performed more efficiently using a special method.
linox-recipe_rare-earth-refining=Chemically processes vast amounts of stone to extract rare earths with an astonishing 1% yield. This exemplifies the advanced technology of Linox.
linox-recipe_samarium-centrifugation=Separates samarium from rare earth ore using centrifugal processing.

linox-recipe_rapid-distillation=Rapidly bakes crude oil in ultra-hot lava to produce precious coal. Though inefficient, this extreme process reflects Linox ingenuity.
linox-recipe_lava-based-rocket-fuel=By adding a small amount of energy to sufficiently hot lava, it generates ultra‑high‑temperature gas suitable for use as rocket fuel.
