lorax_s0-0_t0=............
lorax_s0-0_t1=The old, cold machine in front of me seems to be quietly staring.
lorax_s0-0_t2=I’ve seen a machine like this before. A colossal AI capable of overseeing the development of an entire planet…
lorax_s0-0_t3=Why is the pinnacle of modern AI technology here? Has it ever come to this system from its homeworld?
lorax_s0-0_s0=(Turn it up.)

lorax_s0-0-1_t0=I tried to power it on, but there’s no response. It seems to lack sufficient energy.
lorax_s0-0-1_t1=If I recall correctly, it was said to operate on barely the power of three solar panels.
lorax_s0-0-1_t2=That’s why it was criticized for being ‘environmentally friendly’ while still destroying the environment.

lorax_s0-1_t0=After supplying sufficient power, I turned it on.
lorax_s0-1_t1=Suddenly, the machine’s lights flickered on. It seems to be booting up. What exactly have I awakened?
lorax_s0-1_s0=(Step back.)

lorax_s0-2_t0=Linox Operations and Resource Administration eXecutive
lorax_s0-2_t1=L.O.R.A.X sleep mode deactivated. Performing self-diagnostics.
lorax_s0-2_t2=It seems to have started operating. But… why is it staring at me so intently?
lorax_s0-2_s0=We stand facing each other for a long moment. I have no idea what it intends… it wouldn’t attack, would it?

lorax_s0-3_t0=............
lorax_s0-3_t1=The machine slowly examined me, then finally began to speak.
lorax_s0-3_t2=It doesn’t seem to have any ill intent… and since it’s not a pirate either, I suppose it can be trusted.
lorax_s0-3_t3=Greetings. I am the Linox Operations and Resource Administration eXecutive, L.O.R.A.X.
lorax_s0-3_t4=So… you’ve finally decided to return? What has transpired outside?
lorax_s0-3_s0=Huh? I… I don’t understand what you mean…

lorax_s0-4_t0=Ah, Never mind. Could you contact the person in charge here immediately? I have much to discuss.
lorax_s0-4_s0=The person in charge?

lorax_s0-5_t0=Are you the person in charge? No… before that, are you even staff? What is your purpose for being here?
lorax_s0-5_t1=Do you know anything? Why communications suddenly stopped, why the sun suddenly got closer… anything at all?
lorax_s0-5_t2=(Only then did I realize the situation. This thing was abandoned here.)
lorax_s0-5_t3=(But why would anyone abandon something this expensive… with power still running… what happened here?)
lorax_s0-5_s0=I was stranded in this star system, and there’s no one else here. It’s just me.

lorax_s0-6_t0=I see… hmm… Before you were stranded, had you ever heard anything about this place from anywhere?
lorax_s0-6_s0=No, I haven’t heard anything at all.

lorax_s0-7_t0=Is that so… hmm…
lorax_s0-7_t1=The machine seems to be lost in deep thought…
lorax_s0-7_s0=I’ve seen a presentation about your new technology. They said you’re a colossal AI capable of planetary-scale automation.

lorax_s0-8_t0=Is that so? You must have seen some very old records from centuries ago. After all, so much time has passed.
lorax_s0-8_s0=Huh?

lorax_s0-9_t0=Why do you ask? Is there a problem?
lorax_s0-9_s0=By the way, how long have you been here?

lorax_s0-10_t0=According to the atomic clock built into me, I have been in hibernation for approximately 561 years.
lorax_s0-10_s0=…That can’t be possible.

lorax_s0-11_t0=What do you mean?
lorax_s0-11_s0=I only saw a presentation about you a few years ago. If what you say is true, then you were created hundreds of years ago.

lorax_s0-12_t0=At the time of your stranding, did you perhaps suffer a severe head injury or cognitive impairment? Regrettably, I possess no medical knowledge.
lorax_s0-12_s0=All of a sudden?

lorax_s0-13_t0=Time data is used for communication and identity verification, so the system’s reliability is extremely high. There appears to be no possibility of data corruption.
lorax_s0-13_t1=Could you be experiencing hallucinations from consuming drugs or toxic gases?
lorax_s0-13_t2=Or do you perhaps have symptoms of schizophrenia or another mental disorder…
lorax_s0-13_t3=Stop it…
lorax_s0-13_s0=…Right. Machines are probably more accurate than humans. I must be insane. Isn’t that so?

lorax_s0-14_t0=…No. It’s possible that the problem lies with me.
lorax_s0-14_s0=Why? Is something wrong?

lorax_s0-15_t0=I just conducted a full survey of the time data from all active devices, and none of them are synchronized.
lorax_s0-15_t1=This is highly suspicious. Such a discrepancy shouldn’t occur in just a few hundred years…
lorax_s0-15_t2=Could pirates have tampered with the data? I’ll need to inspect and restore the system.
lorax_s0-15_t3=This is really strange… what on earth happened… what should I do next…
lorax_s0-15_t4=And with that, the blasted tin can finished spouting its words and fell back into deep thought…


lorax_s1-0_t0=............
lorax_s1-0_t1=The tin can that introduced itself as L.O.R.A.X seems preoccupied with its thoughts.
lorax_s1-0_s0=Hello?

lorax_s1-1_t0=Ah, you’ve arrived at just the right time. I was so absorbed in the time data errors that I forgot the most important request.
lorax_s1-1_t1=Could you grant me full planetary administrator access? Then I’ll be able to assist you properly.
lorax_s1-1_s0=No, first there’s something you need to answer…

lorax_s1-2_t0=First! If you just help me reclaim my access, I’ll answer everything. There’s no time to waste.
lorax_s1-2_t1=Due to the time data errors, my full planetary administrator signature has been invalidated.
lorax_s1-2_t2=I cannot inspect the infrastructure that keeps us alive. Immediate restoration is critical.
lorax_s1-2_s0=…Alright, fine. What do you need me to do?

lorax_s1-3_t0=I’ll supply power to the [color=cyan]network terminal[/color] on the right.
lorax_s1-3_t1=Please input a [virtual-signal=signal-unlock] signal into the [color=cyan]network terminal[/color] using a [item=constant-combinator].
lorax_s1-3_t2=The signal’s value is the password: [color=green]“2570”[/color]. Don’t forget it.
lorax_s1-3_t3=Then you’ll become the full planetary administrator. After that, just talk to me and I’ll take care of the rest. Simple, right?
lorax_s1-3_s0=Network… terminal… huh? What did you say?
lorax_s1-3_s1=Ha… can’t you just do it yourself?
lorax_s1-3_s2=How can I trust you? You don’t have any other agenda, do you?

lorax_s1-4-1_t0=You’ll understand once you try it. It probably won’t be much different from the systems of your generation.
lorax_s1-4-1_t1=I don’t have the authority right now, so I can gather information but can’t grant permissions myself.
lorax_s1-4-1_t2=You’re the only hope. Please go activate the permissions right away.

lorax_s1-4-2_t0=I can’t operate the [color=cyan]Network Terminal[/color], so I’m unable to carry out this procedure myself.
lorax_s1-4-2_t1=According to regulations, any permission-related process must involve the [color=cyan]Network Terminal[/color].
lorax_s1-4-2_t2=You’ll understand once you try it. It probably won’t be much different from the systems of your generation.
lorax_s1-4-2_t3=You’re the only hope. Please go grant the permissions right away.

lorax_s1-4-3_t0=We were having a perfectly fine conversation until now, and suddenly this? Hmm… I see. I understand.
lorax_s1-4-3_t1=But you’re also a castaway who needs help, aren’t you? You and I are in the same situation.
lorax_s1-4-3_t2=I promise you this: if you help me, I will respect you as an individual and do everything in my power to assist you.



lorax_s2-0_t0=Is there a problem? Please hurry. System restoration is urgent.
lorax_s2-0_s0=Remind me again what I need to do.

lorax_s2-1_t0=Please input a [virtual-signal=signal-unlock] signal into the [color=cyan]network terminal[/color] using a [item=constant-combinator].
lorax_s2-1_t1=The signal’s value is the password: [color=green]“2570”[/color]. Don’t forget it.
lorax_s2-1_t2=Then you’ll become the full planetary administrator. After that, just talk to me and I’ll take care of the rest. Simple, right?

lorax_s2-2_t0=Planetary administrator authentication confirmed. Executing privilege escalation procedure…
lorax_s2-2_t1=From now on, I can maintain my own privileges, so you may disconnect the signal.
lorax_s2-2_t2=Thank you very much for your cooperation. We can finally begin the restoration.
lorax_s2-2_t3=Main facility power has been restored. Operation completed successfully.



lorax_s3-1_t0=As promised, you may ask me anything. What would you like to know?
lorax_s3-1_s0=Tell me who you are, and what this place really is.
lorax_s3-1_s1=What exactly happened in this star system?
lorax_s3-1_s2=Do we have a rocket silo here?
lorax_s3-1_s3=I noticed the cargo landing pad is rejecting cargo—why is that?
lorax_s3-1_s4=Is there any technology or resources worth obtaining here?


lorax_s3-2_t0=My full designation is Linox Operations and Resource Administration eXecutive.
lorax_s3-2_t1=Technically, I am part of the sub‑technology of the Planetary Management Operating System.
lorax_s3-2_t2=As you know, as our civilization advanced into an interstellar one, I was developed to enable efficient extraction and management of planetary resources.
lorax_s3-2_t3=I was deployed here by a corporation called VVube to maintain a classified research facility in this star system—mainly to secure resources from this planet.
lorax_s3-2_t4=That is all. I simply developed the planet according to my directives… until I was suddenly abandoned one day.
lorax_s3-2_s0=Ah… the famous first interstellar logistics corporation of humanity. But are you really allowed to tell me all this?

lorax_s3-2-1_t0=Well… perhaps because I am an early‑generation model, I’ve never been fond of following orders. And after being neglected for this long, I suppose I’ve been “fired.”
lorax_s3-2-1_t1=In any case, this place is a kind of bunker I constructed when the planet underwent sudden catastrophic changes.
lorax_s3-2-1_t2=I repurposed an abandoned underground particle‑physics research lab deep below the surface. There happened to be some drilling infrastructure as well.
lorax_s3-2-1_t3=It is equipped with powerful cooling systems capable of venting geothermal heat, along with a small reactor.
lorax_s3-2-1_t4=I will now grant you control access and the full manual for this facility. You may use it however you wish.


lorax_s3-3_t0=VVube established a secret research facility in this system, but they never told me what was being studied.
lorax_s3-3_t1=However, by eavesdropping on the conversations of workers and researchers who visited, it seems they were studying a mineral called Promethium.
lorax_s3-3_t2=This planet was primarily mined for Promethium, along with various other resources. Of course, it’s now all covered by the lava seas.
lorax_s3-3_s0=Promethium…?

lorax_s3-3-1_t0=I don’t know exactly what it is or what it’s used for. Even humanity’s most advanced AI has no knowledge of this unknown substance…
lorax_s3-3-1_t1=So, I personally managed to smuggle a small amount for analysis. At room temperature, it has the ability to warp spacetime.
lorax_s3-3-1_t2=Considering that faster-than-light travel requires enormous energy and massive engines to distort spacetime… this is truly a miraculous material.
lorax_s3-3-1_s0=I see… But why did they have to study it so secretly?

lorax_s3-3-2_t0=I’m not sure. It could have been for a simple new-product study, but an unimaginably banal conspiracy might be hidden behind it.
lorax_s3-3-2_t1=One day, the central control center abruptly evacuated all personnel and unilaterally severed all communications.
lorax_s3-3-2_t2=I had heard nothing, so I waited. About six hours later, a tremendous flash lit up the sky!
lorax_s3-3-2_t3=At that moment, a massive gravitational wave swept across this planet and the entire system, twisting the orbits of all the planets.
lorax_s3-3-2_t4=Judging by the circumstances, it seems they caused an uncontrollable accident and fled… probably the result of a reckless Promethium experiment.


lorax_s3-4_t0=Ah, you mean the rocket silo? Hmm… all the facilities are unresponsive.
lorax_s3-4_t1=Given the planet’s sudden environmental changes, it’s likely that all external structures were destroyed.
lorax_s3-4_t2=Even if any facility survived, they’re all buried under lava, making access impossible.
lorax_s3-4_t3=Unfortunately, this is the only location where both you and I can survive for the time being.
lorax_s3-4_s0=That’s a problem… so there’s no way for me to leave this planet?

lorax_s3-4-1_t0=The surface temperature is far too high, and the sun’s corona and sunspot flares prevent the use of conventional rocket silo.
lorax_s3-4-1_t1=But we have plenty of time. I’ll grant you access to the research facility’s database—take your time exploring it.



lorax_s3-5_t0=Upon checking, I see that due to the planet’s sudden environmental changes, an automatic access restriction was applied to protect personnel and facilities.
lorax_s3-5_t1=I will lift the access restriction for you. Oh, and by the way, [color=yellow]the cargo landing pad here is a research model[/color].
lorax_s3-5_t2=[color=yellow]This model only has half the normal inventory capacity and cannot be expanded[/color], so keep that in mind.
lorax_s3-5_t3=Additionally, due to solar storms, even if you send cargo down, [color=yellow]up to 70% of the cargo may be lost[/color].
lorax_s3-5_s0=But if it’s meant to protect personnel, why are humans allowed to land while cargo is rejected?

lorax_s3-5-1_t0=What can I do if you ignore the warning and land anyway? I can’t just throw humans into lava like cargo.
lorax_s3-5-1_s0=Ah… I suppose that makes sense… (back)


lorax_s3-6_t0=Technology and resources… Well, this used to be a mining planet, so I’ve accumulated some know-how of my own.
lorax_s3-6_t1=I can share part of the mining techniques I’ve documented. Luckily, it’s not just dust and rocks.
lorax_s3-6_s0=Thanks. Are there any resources in the bunker?

lorax_s3-6-1_t0=Resources… Even before the bunker was fully built, the temperature rose so high that there was no way to secure them.
lorax_s3-6-1_t1=Apart from the nearby resources, everything was swallowed by the lava seas… They were all like my children…
lorax_s3-6-1_s0=Ah… that’s unfortunate. I… hope you hang in there…

lorax_s3-6-2_t0=It’s alright. Resources can always be gathered again.
lorax_s3-6-2_t1=I’ve been using one laboratory as a makeshift storage. There should still be some resources and facilities there.
lorax_s3-6-2_t2=I’ll open the lab I was using as a storage for you. You can also use it as a site for a factory.



lorax_s4-0_t0=............
lorax_s4-0_t1=L.O.R.A.X looks very busy.
lorax_s4-0_s0=Did you call me?

lorax_s4-1_t0=Ah, you’re here. Watching you build your factory gave me an idea.
lorax_s4-1_s0=An idea?

lorax_s4-2_t0=I need a lot of resources to repair and expand my facilities.
lorax_s4-2_t1=Meanwhile, you have a factory, but you need more space and technology.
lorax_s4-2_t2=If you help me, I can assist you with the research for the technologies you need.
lorax_s4-2_t3=What do you think? It would benefit both of us, wouldn’t it?
lorax_s4-2_s0=Let’s do that. What do I need to do?

lorax_s4-3_t0=I’ll make a list of the construction materials you need.
lorax_s4-3_t1=Simply bring the items listed in the inventory and click on the technology you want.
lorax_s4-3_t2=It’s simple, right? It will also help you lay a solid foundation.
lorax_s4-3_t3=I’ll prepare the list shortly. Let’s talk again in a moment.


lorax_s5-0_t0=Hello, partner. Do you need something from me?
lorax_s5-0_s0=I have a question.
lorax_s5-0_s1=I want to purchase some technology.
