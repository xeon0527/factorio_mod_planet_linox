[recipe-description]
linox-recipe_advanced-acid-neutralisation=Converts sulfuric acid into high-temperature steam. On Linox, this process can be performed more efficiently using a special method.
linox-recipe_rare-earth-refining=Chemically processes vast amounts of stone to extract rare earths with an astonishing 1% yield. This exemplifies the advanced technology of Linox.
linox-recipe_samarium-centrifugation=Separates samarium from rare earth ore using centrifugal processing.

linox-recipe_rapid-distillation=Rapidly bakes crude oil in ultra-hot lava to produce precious coal. Though inefficient, this extreme process reflects Linox ingenuity.
linox-recipe_lava-based-rocket-fuel=By adding a small amount of energy to sufficiently hot lava, it generates ultra‑high‑temperature gas suitable for use as rocket fuel.
