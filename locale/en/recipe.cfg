[recipe-description]
linox-recipe_advanced-acid-neutralisation=Converts sulfuric acid into high-temperature steam. On Linox, this process can be performed more efficiently using a special method.
linox-recipe_rare-earth-refining=Chemically processes vast amounts of stone to extract rare earths with an astonishing 1% yield. This exemplifies the advanced technology of Linox.
linox-recipe_samarium-centrifugation=Separates samarium from rare earth ore using centrifugal processing.

linox-recipe_rapid-distillation=Rapidly bakes crude oil in ultra-hot lava to produce precious coal. Though inefficient, this extreme process reflects Linox ingenuity.
linox-recipe_lava-based-rocket-fuel=By adding a small amount of energy to sufficiently hot lava, it generates ultra‑high‑temperature gas suitable for use as rocket fuel.

linox-recipe_tungsten-stick=Materials made from tungsten exhibit very high operating temperatures and excellent durability.
linox-recipe_linox-supercomputer=A special supercomputer capable of withstanding the harsh environment of Linox. It seems L.O.R.A.X is secretly interested in it.
linox-recipe_lava-data-card=They say the lava on Linox contains almost every substance imaginable dissolved in it. Even lava has something to teach us.
linox-recipe_rare-earth-data-card=Rare earth elements are used as chemical catalysts or to greatly enhance the properties of materials. Why are there so many things in this world to learn?
linox-recipe-samarium-data-card=They say that by understanding samarium, we can gain a deeper understanding of electromagnetic fields under high-temperature conditions. Just how much more do we need to learn?
