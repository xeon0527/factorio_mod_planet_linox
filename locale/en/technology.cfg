[technology-description]
linox-technology_planet-discovery-linox=While studying the sun, a tiny planet orbiting extremely close was discovered. But it’s highly unusual—by all known physics, planets this close to their star should either be pulled in by gravity or torn apart by tidal forces, making their existence impossible. What on earth could it be? More importantly… are you really planning to explore this hellfire?
linox-technology_exploring-linox-landing-site=[color=yellow][font=default-bold]This research requires a space platform to be in orbit around Linox.[/font][/color]\n\nAs the Informatron predicted, the planet has no solid ground. However, if a space platform directly surveys the surface from orbit, you just might find something…
linox-technology-trigger-description_lorax-talking=Unlockable through a conversation with L.O.R.A.X.

linox-technology-trigger-description_lorax-purchase=Purchasing this technology from L.O.R.A.X.

linox-technology_facility-upgrade=To escape Linox, this cramped facility must be industrialized. It’s so tight, there isn’t even room for a parking lot.
linox-technology_planetary-power-network=This facility already has a massive planetary power network in place. If you can make use of it, there’s no need to rebuild the grid. In other words—you won’t have to suffer through a tangle of haphazard power lines.
linox-technology_planetary-power-network-capacity=Increases the capacity of the planetary power network. Each level provides an additional 5 GJ of capacity.
linox-technology_facility-factoryizing=Remove all unnecessary machinery within the facility to make room for a factory. Even then, it doesn’t seem to be enough space.
linox-technology_expanding-factory=Clear out more clutter from the facility to make space. Be careful not to accidentally toss the family photos.
linox-technology-cargo-elevator=Develop a transport system capable of linking the surface of Linox with its underground facilities.
linox-technology_rocket-silo-foundation=Linox’s surface is a sea of ultra-hot lava, making conventional foundations unusable. Additionally, facility entrances cannot support the weight of rocket silos, leaving no suitable base for construction. Developing a specialized floating platform capable of supporting a rocket silo’s load would provide at least a small area for building.

linox-technology_laboratory-database=The Linox research lab database might contain useful technologies from our civilization… or it could be filled with nothing but adult nonsense.
linox-technology_linox-petrochemicals=Bathed in the sun’s immense energy, Linox can exploit its extreme environment to employ unique petrochemical technologies.
linox-technology_recursive-blueprint=Linox researchers have automated even the facility’s blueprints to make the most of limited space. Using this technology, blueprints can be automated to build micro-factories. Who would have thought a factory could fit in the palm of your hand!
linox-technology_tungsten-processing=Components made from processed tungsten exhibit greatly improved temperature resistance and wear durability. Applied to a fork, this prevents slight warping when handling hot food.
linox-technology_turbo-pump=While clearing out junk, a blueprint for a new pump was discovered. According to the notes, it was designed in just one minute using the full computational power of an entire planetary computer. Its performance surpasses that of existing pumps. Why they used a planetary computer for a mere pump, or what took a whole minute, remains a mystery—but hey, if it works, it works.
linox-technology_core-roboport=Tired of seeing robots swarm the roboports like a hive just to recharge, researchers took the existing roboports apart and built a new design. This roboport has a very limited operational range, but compensates with extremely fast charging speed and numerous charging ports.
linox-technology_enhanced-space-engineering=Operating rocket silos on Linox requires an understanding of the sun and high-grade, high-performance materials.
linox-technology_advanced-rocket-silo=Advanced rocket silos operate four times faster than standard silos and can be loaded onto space platform. The painfully slow conventional silos were extremely inefficient. By skipping unnecessary procedures and using high-performance samarium motors, launch time can be reduced by up to 75%. On top of that, optimizing material use makes them light enough to be carried aboard space platform—now that’s impressive!
linox-technology_safety-of-entering-orbit=Increases the probability of cargo preservation during orbital entry by 5% per level. To protect your precious cargo from the sun’s relentless fury, this research is essential.
linox-technology_sintering-machine=By pressing refined powder materials at high temperatures, you can easily produce products in the desired shape without complex processing. It allows you to use exactly the amount of material needed and eliminates processing costs, making it perfect for bosses who care about numbers.

linox-technology_planetary-mining-technology=Linox was once a massive mining planet supplying resources for laboratory operations. There may be useful know-how we can learn from it.
linox-technology_mantle-extraction=Basic planetary mining technology. Excavates tens of kilometers underground to reach the mantle and extract lava. While lava becomes accessible anywhere, the process consumes massive amounts of energy and generates significant pollution.\n\nBe warned: the moment this facility starts operating, environmental groups will be furious and come at you frothing at the mouth. But hey, convenience comes first, right?
linox-technology_stone-extraction=Rocks can be produced directly from lava. If you can get iron and copper, why not stone?
linox-technology_tungsten-extraction=Tungsten can be produced directly from lava. If iron and copper can come out, why not tungsten?
linox-technology_casting-stone-brick=Produces bricks in the foundry. Electric furnaces are now only seen on Aquilo.
linox-technology_rare-earth-refining=Refines trace rare earth elements dissolved in lava. This process generates massive waste and environmental pollution—but on an uninhabited planet, that’s hardly a concern.
linox-technology_samarium-centrifugation=Centrifuges samarium from rare earth ore. Samarium can be used to make permanent magnets that retain their magnetism even at extremely high temperatures, allowing machines made with samarium to operate reliably in harsh environments.
linox-technology_ultra-deep-drilling=Even on a planet covered by seas of lava, remnants of natural resources still exist. This laboratory has drilling facilities that extract resources from great depths underground. Humans truly are relentless creatures.

linox-technology_linox-supercomputer=Linox is one of the worst possible environments for running computers. But work still needs to be done. With tungsten and L.O.R.A.X’s error-correction assistance, supercomputers can now be used even on Linox.
linox-technology_samarium-data-card=Actually, samarium isn’t the magnet that operates at the highest temperatures, but I’ve heard its magnetic strength is much greater, making it more useful. There are so many things in the world to be curious about, and it’s a shame we can’t understand them all!
linox-technology_lorax-support=An interface system is set up so that L.O.R.A.X can support you. For now, L.O.R.A.X only coordinates data production, but the productivity of data card production is increased by a whopping 25%. After all, a calculator shines brightest when it’s used for calculations.
linox-technology_power-converter=Restoring the Mega Power Converter on the planetary power grid will unlock a high-capacity energy storage system with a massive 5 GJ capacity. However, L.O.R.A.X seems... noticeably displeased about this system for some reason.
linox-technology_tungsten-sintering-processing=Using a sintering process, tungsten ore can be immediately processed into usable tungsten products. This method is significantly faster and more efficient than traditional refining — and best of all, it removes an entire step, making production far less tedious.
linox-technology_froth-flotation-processing=The froth flotation process takes advantage of hydrophobic particles' tendency to separate from water. When bubbles are introduced into a slurry, the hydrophobic particles cling to the foam and rise to the surface, allowing easy separation.\n\nThere’s a meme in a small East Asian country that says, “Water knows the answer.” It reminds me of water torture, but I’m sure that’s just a coincidence.
linox-technology_dysprosium-extraction=Through froth flotation and various other steps, highly pure and extremely valuable dysprosium can be extracted. This powder can be used for data card production — or sold on the market for anywhere from $200 to over $1,000 per kilogram.
linox-technology_dysprosium-data-card=Dysprosium could be described as the “magic dust” of permanent magnets, yet only about 3,100 tons were produced worldwide in 2021. Should we really be burning through such a rare metal just to manufacture data cards?
linox-technology_dysprosium-exoskeleton-equipment=Take a look at the old exoskeleton — thin legs ready to snap, a ridiculous 200 kW power demand, and movement slower than a dying snail. Frustrating, right? Well, sprinkle a little magical dysprosium dust on it, and boom — instant performance boost, almost like magic! And all of this for only $39,999!

linox-technology_build-data-catalog=According to L.O.R.A.X, our research achievements are starting to accumulate meaningfully, and it seems we need to manage them systematically. Organizing the collected data will improve the productivity of advanced data cards and unlock high-level research.
linox-technology_chemical-particle-filtering=Selectively separates desired particles using chemical methods. This process requires considerable chemical knowledge, but most likely L.O.R.A.X and the machines will handle it for us. Learning something new is hard, after all.
linox-technology_waste-water-treatment=In fact, "wastewater treatment" is just a polite way of saying you throw it away. Like the mantle extractor, this facility is probably the least favorite of environmental groups, though it's unlikely they’ll reach Linox.
linox-technology_neodymium-extraction=Unlocks the neodymium extraction process. Extracting rare earths is tedious, requires vast resources and water, and produces enormous amounts of waste. But for neodymium, it’s all worth it. Since you’re already on Linox, why not see it through to the end?
linox-technology_neodymium-data-card=Neodymium is used to manufacture the world’s most powerful permanent magnets, and nowadays you can find it in almost any slightly expensive electrical device around you. In fact, the electricity running the computer reading this text may have come from neodymium magnets.
linox-technology_neodymium-permanent-magnet=By mixing neodymium powder with dysprosium and iron and sintering it, the famous neodymium permanent magnet is created. Boron should also be added, but it’s difficult for both implementers and players, so we left it out. The key point is that this magnet is extremely useful.
linox-technology_neodymium-permanent-magnet-generator=Finally, we can introduce this product to you. Using neodymium permanent magnets, enormous amounts of energy can be handled in a small space. This generator produces a staggering 43 times more power than a standard steam turbine! And as a bonus, a huge heat exchanger is included.

linox-technology_erbium-extraction=Unlocks the erbium extraction process. It seems very similar to the neodymium extraction process, but it’s definitely not lazily made this way. Turns out all rare earth elements are produced like this: mostly adding additives and concentrating hundreds of times. No wonder it generates massive pollution.
linox-technology_erbium-data-card=Erbium is mainly used as an optical amplification additive. It’s said that adding it to optical fibers drastically improves signal quality. You might even be using fiber cables containing erbium when connecting to multiplayer servers!
linox-technology_erbium-beacon=It’s true that erbium reduces optical signal loss, but honestly, I’m not sure how this relates to Factorio beacons. Anyway, using erbium can improve beacon performance, allowing up to 4 modules. Upgrades from existing beacons are also possible!

linox-technology_rare-earth-powder-productivity=It improves rare earth production. and as a small bonus, it also reduces pollution.
linox-technology_get-cargo-landing-pad=Obtain control of the main cargo landing pad from L.O.R.A.X. This will allow you to receive cargo from orbit.
linox-technology_basic-material-sintering-processing=Processes iron and copper ore through sintering to produce finished products. Shaping materials by force to the desired form is an ancient tradition that dates back to the Stone Age.
linox-technology_sintering-machine-productivity=Improves the productivity of the sintering machine. It seems like more comes out than the materials you put in… could this be called "creation"?

linox-technology_ground-platform-expansion=Thinking about it, the underground facility is already sitting inside a literal sea of lava, so why wouldn’t we be able to expand the surface platform even further? After realizing that, I immediately ran to L.O.R.A.X and demanded to know why expansion wasn’t possible. The response I got was: “Because you never requested it.” Once again, even the smallest things matter. always speak up.
linox-technology_samarium-robotics=By harnessing Samarium’s high-temperature properties, flying robots can gain enhanced durability and fire immunity, and temporarily operate at 300% overload. It’s like “eat fast, poop fast.”
linox-technology_dysprosium-electric-motor-robot=Adding trace amounts of Dysprosium to the motors of flying robots can improve power efficiency by up to 25%. Dysprosium really does seem like magical powder but don’t eat it. it’s a heavy metal.
linox-technology_neodymium-permanent-magnet-inserter=By harnessing the immense torque of neodymium permanent-magnet motors, inserter performance can be boosted to revolutionary levels. Their arms move so fast that it’s nearly impossible to track them with the naked eye. You might even get dizzy—so please, kids, don’t try this at home.

linox-moshine-technology_neodymium-crushing=In Moshine, high-purity natural neodymium can be easily mined. Simply crushing this natural neodymium yields neodymium powder immediately. Having such a rare high-purity rare earth just lying on the ground — Moshine is truly a magnetist’s paradise!
linox-technology_planetary-power-converter-capacity=Expands the capacity of the Power Converter. You gain an additional 2.5 GJ per level.\n\nEven after being abandoned for centuries, it still works for humanity. Can’t we invest just a little? Please respect the rights of the machines.
linox-technology_outer-corridor-open=Opens the outer corridor surrounding the facility. This corridor was originally completely blocked by lava and rock, but L.O.R.A.X cleared it while we were busy with other tasks. Come to think of it, the researcher logs didn’t really have any complaints about the bathrooms.

linox-technology_adding-pipeline=Adds a new Deep Drilling Facility pipeline. Newly created pipelines are installed on the inner corridor walls at random locations.\n\nSince the deep drilling facility was not originally designed to connect to the lab, you unfortunately can’t place pipelines wherever you want. Instead, L.O.R.A.X has improved the piping so that you can choose which resource it outputs. Pretty clever, right?
linox-technology_pipeline-productivity=Improves the productivity of the deep drilling facility.\n\nIn reality, there isn’t much for the player to do with this research, since you can’t directly interact with the deep drilling facility. All improvements to it are handled by L.O.R.A.X. As the research level increases, L.O.R.A.X’s workload apparently grows tremendously. Come to think of it, I was wondering why some strange toxic-gas-like stuff has been coming up through the pipelines lately… L.O.R.A.X, don’t tell me you’re—
