[technology-description]
linox-technology_planet-discovery-linox=While studying the sun, a tiny planet orbiting extremely close was discovered. But it’s highly unusual—by all known physics, planets this close to their star should either be pulled in by gravity or torn apart by tidal forces, making their existence impossible. What on earth could it be? More importantly… are you really planning to explore this hellfire?
linox-technology_exploring-linox-landing-site=[color=yellow][font=default-bold]This research requires a space platform to be in orbit around Linox.[/font][/color]\n\nAs the Informatron predicted, the planet has no solid ground. However, if a space platform directly surveys the surface from orbit, you just might find something…
linox-technology-trigger-description_lorax-talking=Unlockable through a conversation with L.O.R.A.X.

linox-technology_facility-upgrade=To escape Linox, this cramped facility must be industrialized. It’s so tight, there isn’t even room for a parking lot.
linox-technology_planetary-power-network=This facility already has a massive planetary power network in place. If you can make use of it, there’s no need to rebuild the grid. In other words—you won’t have to suffer through a tangle of haphazard power lines.
linox-technology_planetary-power-network-capacity=Increases the capacity of the planetary power network. Each level provides an additional 5 GJ of capacity.
linox-technology_facility-factoryizing=Remove all unnecessary machinery within the facility to make room for a factory. Even then, it doesn’t seem to be enough space.
linox-technology_expanding-factory=Clear out more clutter from the facility to make space. Be careful not to accidentally toss the family photos.
linox-technology-cargo-elevator=Develop a transport system capable of linking the surface of Linox with its underground facilities.
linox-technology_rocket-silo-foundation=Linox’s surface is a sea of ultra-hot lava, making conventional foundations unusable. Additionally, facility entrances cannot support the weight of rocket silos, leaving no suitable base for construction. Developing a specialized floating platform capable of supporting a rocket silo’s load would provide at least a small area for building.

linox-technology_laboratory-database=The Linox research lab database might contain useful technologies from our civilization… or it could be filled with nothing but adult nonsense.
linox-technology_linox-petrochemicals=Bathed in the sun’s immense energy, Linox can exploit its extreme environment to employ unique petrochemical technologies.
linox-technology_recursive-blueprint=Linox researchers have automated even the facility’s blueprints to make the most of limited space. Using this technology, blueprints can be automated to build micro-factories. Who would have thought a factory could fit in the palm of your hand!
linox-technology_tungsten-processing=Components made from processed tungsten exhibit greatly improved temperature resistance and wear durability. Applied to a fork, this prevents slight warping when handling hot food.
linox-technology_turbo-pump=While clearing out junk, a blueprint for a new pump was discovered. According to the notes, it was designed in just one minute using the full computational power of an entire planetary computer. Its performance surpasses that of existing pumps. Why they used a planetary computer for a mere pump, or what took a whole minute, remains a mystery—but hey, if it works, it works.
linox-technology_core-roboport=Tired of seeing robots swarm the roboports like a hive just to recharge, researchers took the existing roboports apart and built a new design. This roboport has a very limited operational range, but compensates with extremely fast charging speed and numerous charging ports.
linox-technology_enhanced-space-engineering=Operating rocket silos on Linox requires an understanding of the sun and high-grade, high-performance materials.
linox-technology_advanced-rocket-silo=Advanced rocket silos operate four times faster than standard silos and can be loaded onto space platform. The painfully slow conventional silos were extremely inefficient. By skipping unnecessary procedures and using high-performance samarium motors, launch time can be reduced by up to 75%. On top of that, optimizing material use makes them light enough to be carried aboard space platform—now that’s impressive!
linox-technology_safety-of-entering-orbit=Increases the probability of cargo preservation during orbital entry by 5% per level. To protect your precious cargo from the sun’s relentless fury, this research is essential.

linox-technology_planetary-mining-technology=Linox was once a massive mining planet supplying resources for laboratory operations. There may be useful know-how we can learn from it.
linox-technology_mantle-extraction=Basic planetary mining technology. Excavates tens of kilometers underground to reach the mantle and extract lava. While lava becomes accessible anywhere, the process consumes massive amounts of energy and generates significant pollution.\n\nBe warned: the moment this facility starts operating, environmental groups will be furious and come at you frothing at the mouth. But hey, convenience comes first, right?
linox-technology_stone-extraction=Rocks can be produced directly from lava. If you can get iron and copper, why not stone?
linox-technology_tungsten-extraction=Tungsten can be produced directly from lava. If iron and copper can come out, why not tungsten?
linox-technology_casting-stone-brick=Produces bricks in the foundry. Electric furnaces are now only seen on Aquilo.
linox-technology_rare-earth-refining=Refines trace rare earth elements dissolved in lava. This process generates massive waste and environmental pollution—but on an uninhabited planet, that’s hardly a concern.
linox-technology_samarium-centrifugation=Centrifuges samarium from rare earth ore. Samarium can be used to make permanent magnets that retain their magnetism even at extremely high temperatures, allowing machines made with samarium to operate reliably in harsh environments.
linox-technology_ultra-deep-drilling=Even on a planet covered by seas of lava, remnants of natural resources still exist. This laboratory has drilling facilities that extract resources from great depths underground. Humans truly are relentless creatures.
