[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
linox-tips-and-tricks_briefing=[planet=linox-planet_linox] is an extraordinarily destructive world, even closer to the sun than Vulcanus. Solar coronal ejections and flares reach all the way down to the surface, obliterating everything in their path, while the sun’s immense gravitational forces relentlessly twist and deform the entire planet, creating an extreme and hostile environment. Is there really anything left on such a world that could still be worth extracting?
linox-tips-and-tricks_exploration-log-1=Long-range scans indicate that the intense heat from the massive sun has melted the surface, making it difficult to find suitable landing sites. To explore the planet, a space platform must first survey appropriate landing zones from orbit. Landing here will result in certain death.
linox-tips-and-tricks_exploration-log-2=After multiple attempts to survey the surface using space platform, something was detected on the radar. Astonishingly, an unidentified [entity=cargo-landing-pad] was prominently installed in the middle of a lava sea. Remote access attempts indicate that it is unfortunately configured to reject all types of landings. Due to strong security measures, this setting is unlikely to be changed in the near future. However, given the tendencies of our civilization, it is probable that manned space platform landings will still be allowed.\n\nEven if a forced landing is attempted, the planet’s resources may be unusable due to the powerful solar corona, making survival unlikely. Do you wish to continue?
linox-tips-and-tricks_cargo-loss=[planet=linox-planet_linox] is so close to its sun that solar corona and flares reach the planet’s surface. As a result, cargo pods may be damaged or destroyed, and only about 30% of cargo is expected to land successfully. Landing success can be improved through the Orbital Entry Stability research.\n\n * Cargo pods occupied by the player cannot be destroyed.\n * Base success rate: 30%\n * Each level of Orbital Entry Stability research increases success rate by 5 percentage points.\n * Success is calculated for each item slot in the cargo pod. Lost items are removed from their respective slots.
linox-tips-and-tricks_placement_restriction=Only a very limited set of entities can be placed on [tile=linox-tile_linox-terminal-platform], [tile=linox-tile_linox-hazard-terminal-platform], [tile=linox-tile_linox-corridor], and [tile=linox-tile_linox-datacenter].\nIn particular, [entity=linox-building_cargo-elevator] and [entity=linox-building_fluid-elevator] can only be placed on [tile=linox-tile_linox-terminal-platform] and [tile=linox-tile_linox-hazard-terminal-platform].
linox-tips-and-tricks_planetary-power-network=Linox already has a massive planetary power network installed. Because of this, power poles are unnecessary, and the surface and underground power networks are interconnected.
linox-tips-and-tricks_npc-system=NPCs are special entities that affect game progression and display their names in yellow at the bottom. Some NPCs can be interacted with by clicking on them.

linox-tips-and-tricks_recursive-blueprints=The Recursive Blueprint System allows full automation of blueprint placement and removal. With this system, you can automate the production of various items even in extremely limited space.\nIn the help sections below, we will briefly introduce the example recursive blueprint setup included in Linox and explain its functionality.\n\nWarning – The simulation on this page is slightly different from the actual example provided in-game, as it is configured to clearly demonstrate the standard behavior of the Recursive Blueprint System.
linox-tips-and-tricks_rs-latch=An RS latch is a circuit that Sets or Resets its output signal depending on conditions. It maintains its current output until the condition changes.\nIn this example, the RS latch is used to manage stock levels by keeping the amount of [item=copper-plate] above a certain value and the amount of [item=stone] below a certain value.\n\nIn the example image, the red [item=copper-plate] circuit Sets the signal when stock is below 500 and Resets it when stock exceeds 1000.\nThe blue [item=stone] circuit on the right Sets the signal when stock exceeds 2000 and Resets it when stock drops below 1000.\n\nRemember: both are RS latches, but their settings differ depending on the desired behavior. When an RS latch is Set, the circuit outputs the value stored in the [item=constant-combinator].\nNotice that each item has a different output value. These values represent the blueprint order and priority — lower values have higher priority.
linox-tips-and-tricks_signal-converter=The circuit marked in purple receives input from multiple RS latches and selects only the signal with the lowest value, then converts it into a Recursive Blueprint signal.\nFor more details on Recursive Blueprint signals, refer to the tips section of that mod.\n\nThe circuit marked in green briefly interrupts output whenever the Recursive Blueprint signal changes. During this interruption, a deconstruction command is triggered, removing the previously placed blueprint.
linox-tips-and-tricks_bad-chest=The finalized signal is sent into the BAD Chest from the Recursive Blueprints mod. This chest stores the actual blueprint book used for construction. Remember how each item had a different value in the RS latch section? That value determines which blueprint will be selected and used.\n\nThe [item=constant-combinator] to the left of the BAD Chest defines its operating range and also provides the deconstruction signal. Placement signals have priority over deconstruction signals.
linox-tips-and-tricks_bad-chest-area-viewer=The BAD Chest Area Indicator visually displays both the operating area and the center point of the BAD Chest. The operating area defines where deconstruction commands apply, while the center point determines where blueprints are placed — so be sure to check it carefully.
linox-tips-and-tricks_adjust-blueprint-origin=Sometimes a blueprint may not be placed exactly where you intended, as shown by the red highlight.\nTo correct this, adjust the blueprint origin in the blueprint editor — shown with the orange highlight — by modifying the X and Y values currently set to 6 and 8.\nThese values change the blueprint’s placement anchor (the upper-left tile of the square containing the flag icon).\nAfter adjusting the values, you should see the blueprint place correctly, as shown by the green highlight.

linox-tips-and-tricks_power-converter=The Power Converter is a system that provides a large amount of power capacity to Linox facilities. At the bottom of this special accumulator, there are circuit input and output ports, where you can connect circuit wires to directly control the Power Converter.
linox-tips-and-tricks_reactive-power=Hello. Partner. This is L.O.R.A.X. I’m contacting you urgently because there’s an important matter before using the Power Converter.\n\nCurrently, the main circuit of the Power Converter is damaged. Because of this, [color=yellow]turning on the Power Converter may generate “reactive power,” which can increase total power consumption by up to 2×[/color]. To solve this problem, you must implement the main circuit operation directly using circuit signals.\n[color=yellow]What we need to do is supply an appropriate amount of auxiliary power to correct the reactive power.[/color] Don’t worry. It’s not as difficult as it sounds, and the only difference compared to before is a slight drop in precision.\n\n\nThe Power Converter outputs the following signals:\n\n[virtual-signal=signal-P] shows the current total power consumption excluding reactive power, in watts (W).\n[virtual-signal=signal-O] shows the Power Converter output used to offset reactive power, in watts (W).\n\n[color=yellow]Our goal is to keep the value of [virtual-signal=signal-O] as close as possible to [virtual-signal=signal-P].[/color]\nThe magnitude of [virtual-signal=signal-O] cannot be directly controlled. It can only be influenced indirectly via signal inputs.\n\n\nThe Power Converter accepts the following input signals:\n\n[virtual-signal=signal-E] Setting this signal to a non-zero value activates the Power Converter. You gain 5 GJ of power capacity, but reactive power begins to occur.\nIf you do not want to control reactive power, you can use this signal to turn off the Power Converter, but you will forfeit its power capacity.\n\n[virtual-signal=signal-I] controls the Power Converter output.\nSetting [virtual-signal=signal-I] to 1 or higher increases the output.\nSetting [virtual-signal=signal-I] to -1 or lower decreases the output.\n\nThe Power Converter output cannot be directly set; it can only be adjusted up or down through positive or negative input values.\n\n\nTo put it in terms of a car, [virtual-signal=signal-I] works like an accelerator pedal.\nEven if you press the pedal all the way down, it takes time for the car to reach its top speed.\n\nBy adding or subtracting the [virtual-signal=signal-I] signal at the appropriate time, you can control the Power Converter output to the desired level.\n\nIf controlled correctly, the proportion of reactive power in the power statistics will drop significantly. Good luck!
linox-tips-and-tricks_placement_restriction2=Placement of chests and [item=linox-building_core-roboport] is allowed on [tile=linox-tile_linox-facility-platform] and [tile=linox-tile_linox-hazard-facility-platform] tiles. For everything else, the same placement restrictions as Restriction 1 apply.
