[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
linox-tips-and-tricks_briefing=[planet=linox-planet_linox] is an extraordinarily destructive world, even closer to the sun than Vulcanus. Solar coronal ejections and flares reach all the way down to the surface, obliterating everything in their path, while the sun’s immense gravitational forces relentlessly twist and deform the entire planet, creating an extreme and hostile environment. Is there really anything left on such a world that could still be worth extracting?
linox-tips-and-tricks_language-settings=Before diving into Linox, we strongly recommend setting the options shown in the image to match your preferred language. These settings are used to localize the Recursive Blueprint example and will be a big help as you progress.\n\nAdditionally, if you change your language in the personal settings and then ask L.O.R.A.X to restore the example again, you can receive the example in a different language as well.
linox-tips-and-tricks_exploration-log-1=Long-range scans indicate that the intense heat from the massive sun has melted the surface, making it difficult to find suitable landing sites. To explore the planet, a space platform must first survey appropriate landing zones from orbit. Landing here will result in certain death.
linox-tips-and-tricks_exploration-log-2=After multiple attempts to scan the surface using spacecraft, something finally appeared on the radar. Surprisingly, an unidentified [entity=cargo-landing-pad] was boldly placed in the middle of the lava ocean. When attempting remote access, it seems the pad is configured to reject all landing types. Due to strong security protocols, changing this setting won’t be possible anytime soon — but considering our civilization’s tendencies, it’s unlikely it will reject a manned landing.\n\nA forced crewed landing is possible, but be warned: due to intense solar coronal activity and the landing pad’s refusal to accept cargo drops, no support can be received from the orbital platform. Survival may not be guaranteed. Proceed?
linox-tips-and-tricks_cargo-loss=[planet=linox-planet_linox] is so close to its sun that solar corona and flares reach the planet’s surface. As a result, cargo pods may be damaged or destroyed, and only about 30% of cargo is expected to land successfully. Landing success can be improved through the Orbital Entry Stability research.\n\n * Cargo pods occupied by the player cannot be destroyed.\n * Base success rate: 30%\n * Each level of Orbital Entry Stability research increases success rate by 5 percentage points.\n * Success is calculated for each item slot in the cargo pod. Lost items are removed from their respective slots.
linox-tips-and-tricks_placement_restriction=Only a very limited set of entities can be placed on [tile=linox-tile_linox-terminal-platform], [tile=linox-tile_linox-hazard-terminal-platform], [tile=linox-tile_linox-corridor], and [tile=linox-tile_linox-datacenter].\nIn particular, [entity=linox-building_cargo-elevator] and [entity=linox-building_fluid-elevator] can only be placed on [tile=linox-tile_linox-terminal-platform] and [tile=linox-tile_linox-hazard-terminal-platform].
linox-tips-and-tricks_planetary-power-network=Linox already has a massive planetary power network installed. Because of this, power poles are unnecessary, and the surface and underground power networks are interconnected.
linox-tips-and-tricks_npc-system=NPCs are special entities that affect game progression and display their names in yellow at the bottom. Some NPCs can be interacted with by clicking on them.

linox-tips-and-tricks_recursive-blueprints=The Recursive Blueprint System allows full automation of blueprint placement and removal. With this system, you can automate the production of various items even in extremely limited space.\nIn the help sections below, we will briefly introduce the example recursive blueprint setup included in Linox and explain its functionality.\n\nWarning – The simulation on this page is slightly different from the actual example provided in-game, as it is configured to clearly demonstrate the standard behavior of the Recursive Blueprint System.
linox-tips-and-tricks_example-turn-on=To start the example, two steps are required.\n\nFirst, at the top of the example, find the [item=constant-combinator] that outputs the [virtual-signal=signal-green] signal and turn it on.\n\nNext, toggle the pause signal located at the bottom once (on and then off) to reset the system. After that, the system will operate normally.
linox-tips-and-tricks_bad-chest=The blueprints used by the example circuit can be found in the blueprint book placed inside the [item=blueprint-deployer2] shown in the diagram. The placement order of the blueprints within this book is very important, which I’ll explain in the next tip.
linox-tips-and-tricks_id-box=In the middle of the example, you can find two [item=constant-combinator]s. These ID boxes determine which blueprint from the blueprint book seen in the [item=blueprint-deployer2] will be used for a given item signal.\nFor example, if the [item=iron-plate] signal has a value of 4, the fourth blueprint in the blueprint book will be used when the [item=iron-plate] signal is sent. Lower values (blueprints placed higher in the book) have higher priority.\n\nBut why are there two [item=constant-combinator]s? Check the next page to find out!
linox-tips-and-tricks_negative-signal=At the bottom of the example, you can find four [item=constant-combinator]s outputting item signals. These combinators are used to set the output conditions for item signals. The two on the left output inverted item signals, which are useful when using blueprints that reduce the stock of desired items.\n\nThe first combinator is set to turn off the signal when the stock of the desired item falls below a certain amount. In the example, the [item=stone] signal is set to 1500. This means that when [item=stone] is 1500 or fewer, the signal turns off. Note that this is a turn-off condition; the signal does not turn back on if the quantity rises above 1500. The turn-on condition can be set in the second combinator.\n\nThe second combinator is set to turn on the signal when the stock of the desired item exceeds a certain amount. In the example, the [item=stone] signal is set to 3000. This means that when [item=stone] exceeds 3000, the signal turns on.
linox-tips-and-tricks_positive-signal=The two on the right also output item signals, and unlike the inverted signals, they are useful when using blueprints that increase the stock of desired items.\n\nThe third combinator is set to turn on the signal when the stock of the desired item falls below a certain amount. In the example, the [item=iron-plate] signal is set to 500. This means that when [item=iron-plate] is 500 or fewer, the signal turns on. Otherwise, it works the same as the inverted signals.\n\nThe fourth combinator is set to turn off the signal when the stock of the desired item exceeds a certain amount. In the example, the [item=iron-plate] signal is set to 2000. This means that when [item=iron-plate] exceeds 2000, the signal turns off.
linox-tips-and-tricks_hover-tips=The combinators in the example contain various important descriptions. Be sure to click on or hover over the combinators to check the details.

#linox-tips-and-tricks_rs-latch=An RS latch is a circuit that Sets or Resets its output signal depending on conditions. It maintains its current output until the condition changes.\nIn this example, the RS latch is used to manage stock levels by keeping the amount of [item=copper-plate] above a certain value and the amount of [item=stone] below a certain value.\n\nIn the example image, the red [item=copper-plate] circuit Sets the signal when stock is below 500 and Resets it when stock exceeds 1000.\nThe blue [item=stone] circuit on the right Sets the signal when stock exceeds 2000 and Resets it when stock drops below 1000.\n\nRemember: both are RS latches, but their settings differ depending on the desired behavior. When an RS latch is Set, the circuit outputs the value stored in the [item=constant-combinator].\nNotice that each item has a different output value. These values represent the blueprint order and priority — lower values have higher priority.
#linox-tips-and-tricks_signal-converter=The circuit marked in purple receives input from multiple RS latches and selects only the signal with the lowest value, then converts it into a Recursive Blueprint signal.\nFor more details on Recursive Blueprint signals, refer to the tips section of that mod.\n\nThe circuit marked in green briefly interrupts output whenever the Recursive Blueprint signal changes. During this interruption, a deconstruction command is triggered, removing the previously placed blueprint.
#linox-tips-and-tricks_bad-chest=The finalized signal is sent into the BAD Chest from the Recursive Blueprints mod. This chest stores the actual blueprint book used for construction. Remember how each item had a different value in the RS latch section? That value determines which blueprint will be selected and used.\n\nThe [item=constant-combinator] to the left of the BAD Chest defines its operating range and also provides the deconstruction signal. Placement signals have priority over deconstruction signals.
linox-tips-and-tricks_bad-chest-area-viewer=The BAD Chest Area Indicator visually displays both the operating area and the center point of the BAD Chest. The operating area defines where deconstruction commands apply, while the center point determines where blueprints are placed — so be sure to check it carefully.
linox-tips-and-tricks_adjust-blueprint-origin=Sometimes a blueprint may not be placed exactly where you intended, as shown by the red highlight.\nTo correct this, adjust the blueprint origin in the blueprint editor — shown with the orange highlight — by modifying the X and Y values currently set to 6 and 8.\nThese values change the blueprint’s placement anchor (the upper-left tile of the square containing the flag icon).\nAfter adjusting the values, you should see the blueprint place correctly, as shown by the green highlight.

linox-tips-and-tricks_power-converter=The Power Converter is a system that provides a large amount of power capacity to Linox facilities. At the bottom of this special accumulator, there are circuit input and output ports, where you can connect circuit wires to directly control the Power Converter.
linox-tips-and-tricks_reactive-power=Hello. Partner. This is L.O.R.A.X. I’m contacting you urgently because there’s an important matter before using the Power Converter.\n\nCurrently, the main circuit of the Power Converter is damaged. Because of this, [color=yellow]turning on the Power Converter may generate “reactive power,” which can increase total power consumption by up to 2×[/color]. To solve this problem, you must implement the main circuit operation directly using circuit signals.\n[color=yellow]What we need to do is supply an appropriate amount of auxiliary power to correct the reactive power.[/color] Don’t worry. It’s not as difficult as it sounds, and the only difference compared to before is a slight drop in precision.\n\n\nThe Power Converter outputs the following signals:\n\n[virtual-signal=signal-P] shows the current total power consumption excluding reactive power, in watts (W).\n[virtual-signal=signal-O] shows the Power Converter output used to offset reactive power, in watts (W).\n\n[color=yellow]Our goal is to keep the value of [virtual-signal=signal-O] as close as possible to [virtual-signal=signal-P].[/color]\nThe magnitude of [virtual-signal=signal-O] cannot be directly controlled. It can only be influenced indirectly via signal inputs.\n\n\nThe Power Converter accepts the following input signals:\n\n[virtual-signal=signal-E] Setting this signal to a non-zero value activates the Power Converter. You gain 5 GJ of power capacity, but reactive power begins to occur.\nIf you do not want to control reactive power, you can use this signal to turn off the Power Converter, but you will forfeit its power capacity.\n\n[virtual-signal=signal-I] controls the Power Converter output.\nSetting [virtual-signal=signal-I] to 1 or higher increases the output.\nSetting [virtual-signal=signal-I] to -1 or lower decreases the output.\n\nThe Power Converter output cannot be directly set; it can only be adjusted up or down through positive or negative input values.\n\n\nTo put it in terms of a car, [virtual-signal=signal-I] works like an accelerator pedal.\nEven if you press the pedal all the way down, it takes time for the car to reach its top speed.\n\nBy adding or subtracting the [virtual-signal=signal-I] signal at the appropriate time, you can control the Power Converter output to the desired level.\n\nIf controlled correctly, the proportion of reactive power in the power statistics will drop significantly. Good luck!
linox-tips-and-tricks_placement_restriction_2=Placement of chests and [item=linox-building_core-roboport] and [item=accumulator] is allowed on [tile=linox-tile_linox-facility-platform] and [tile=linox-tile_linox-hazard-facility-platform] tiles. For everything else, the same placement restrictions as Restriction 1 apply.
