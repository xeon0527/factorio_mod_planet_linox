linox-tips-and-tricks_briefing=[planet=linox-planet_linox] is an extraordinarily destructive world, even closer to the sun than Vulcanus. Solar coronal ejections and flares reach all the way down to the surface, obliterating everything in their path, while the sun’s immense gravitational forces relentlessly twist and deform the entire planet, creating an extreme and hostile environment. Is there really anything left on such a world that could still be worth extracting?
linox-tips-and-tricks_exploration-log-1=Long-range scans indicate that the intense heat from the massive sun has melted the surface, making it difficult to find suitable landing sites. To explore the planet, a spacecraft must first survey appropriate landing zones from orbit. Landing here will result in certain death.
linox-tips-and-tricks_exploration-log-2=After multiple attempts to survey the surface using spacecraft, something was detected on the radar. Astonishingly, an unidentified [entity=cargo-landing-pad] was prominently installed in the middle of a lava sea. Remote access attempts indicate that it is unfortunately configured to reject all types of landings. Due to strong security measures, this setting is unlikely to be changed in the near future. However, given the tendencies of our civilization, it is probable that manned spacecraft landings will still be allowed.\n\nEven if a forced landing is attempted, the planet’s resources may be unusable due to the powerful solar corona, making survival unlikely. Do you wish to continue?\n[color=yellow]It is strongly recommended to fully automate all Vulcanus-related items and research before attempting access. Escaping this planet will be extremely difficult.[/color]
linox-tips-and-tricks_cargo-loss=[planet=linox-planet_linox] is so close to its sun that solar corona and flares reach the planet’s surface. As a result, cargo pods may be damaged or destroyed, and only about 30% of cargo is expected to land successfully. Landing success can be improved through the Orbital Entry Stability research.\n\n * Cargo pods occupied by the player cannot be destroyed.\n * Base success rate: 30%\n * Each level of Orbital Entry Stability research increases success rate by 5 percentage points.\n * Success is calculated for each item slot in the cargo pod. Lost items are removed from their respective slots.
